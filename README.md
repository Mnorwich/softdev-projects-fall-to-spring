##Main Projects
###SoftDev_Proj01
####Andrew Fischer,Rebecca Yuste-Golub, Hubert 
####Description 
Using the google python module, urlib, and BeautifulSoup we collected the first 30 results from a users google search query and extracted the text from each result.  We then parsed the text to be able to extract names and dates using regex.  If the question was a "who" question, we counted how many times a name was found, storing each unique name and the number of times it appeared in a Python dictionary. for each new name that appeared..  We did the same for "who" questions.  In theory the name/date that appeared the most was the correct answer.
